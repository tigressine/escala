Decisions:
    Scale of Map: 
        Countries, REGION, Continents 
    Time Period:
        start date:  PRESENT DAY, 2000s, 1750s, 2200 ???
        time scale:  1 day per 1/10 sec  pause when entering menu
    Products:
        CARS, food, electronics, blenders, tiolet paper, clothing
    
    

Basic:
    Map - respond to mouse clicks, identify correct region.
    Products - one functionally developed product (game play is possible and not excruciatingly boring)
    Events - 
    Spread - 
        standards must be met
        logistics (land, sea, air)
        Bi-directional spanning tree for continant maps

Stretch:
    Map: 
        tactile/visual interaction (regions are highlighted when mouse hovers)
        multiple playable maps
        custom map generation engine (would be really complicated... needs to also create policys)
    Products:
        multiple fully developed products
    Difficulty:
        multiple difficult levels
    Music:
    Multiplayer:
        multi human / AI ???
